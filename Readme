Aldrich, Suzanne	aigeanta@cs.stanford.eduComment: I improved the interface so that shapes that are too small (ie knobs on top of each other) can be resizedbut not moved so they don't get stuck. I really didn't like having the knobbies disappear when the shape is selected because it's confusing and violates good HI principles.
